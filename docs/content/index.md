# Zensical Docs Template
This is a Zensical Docs Template repository. It includes GitHub and GitLab CI workflows to easily publish pages.

To use, invoke:

```shell
cd docs/
```
```shell
uv run zensical serve
```

This will publish the documentation at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/) by default, and watch for any changes to the documentation source files.
